//! The set1 module manages the declaration of the challenge modules for this set. 
//! This module is the qualifying set. The exercises here are to ramp developers up
//! gradually into being able to code cryptography challenges. It's said that these 
//! are easy. For some I suppose. My implementation of these challenges is done using
//! Rust and I'm a Java professional first. Rust is a good choice for these challenges.
