A loop is used to *test* each single-repeatable hex character, representing the alphabet (in decimal) between 65 and 123. Each decimal is converted to a 2 char hex representation and then repeated 34 times creating a string of similar lenght to the *encrypted* hex string given. Each XOR produces what could be the secret message and the function here does a word count. The XOR output with the most number of words is kept and when the loop is terminated, the function returns this  *best* usize value."],["word_count","This function returns a usize primitive with the integer count of a provided std::string argument (statically addressable string)"]]});
